Stable Team Task Tracker

Stable management requires the coordination of many tasks across multiple animals performed by multiple caretakers. Issues arise when uncompleted tasks are not communicated among the caretakers. We desire a system that allows daily checklists to be attached to multiple animals or other assets and shared across a user base that can access/update these checklists using a mobile device.  Cross cutting views across different task types and locations should be supported, as well as possible task assignment. Task completion should be tracked, and tasks should reset on a regular basis.  Notification of expiring tasks and history reporting of past performance are needed as well.
